# Null Object Pattern

### What do we do exactly?
Add an extra class/object to your code ( prefix the name of the class/object with "Null").
Instead of returning null, return the Null object

### After applying the Null Object Pattern:
Saves you from doing all the null checks throughout your code, which you may forget some 
and make your app crash. 
Make the null check once when you get the object itself.
